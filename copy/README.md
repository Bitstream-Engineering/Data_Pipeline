This Golang data pipeline provides a flexible, extensible framework for processing data through multiple stages. The implementation features:

Modular Architecture:

Interfaces for data sources, processors, and sinks
Easy to extend with new implementations


Key Components:

Sources: Read data from external systems (file implementation provided)
Processors: Transform, filter, and aggregate data
Sinks: Output processed data (file and console implementations provided)


Processing Features:

Filtering based on predicates
Data transformation
Time-window based aggregation
Parallel processing with worker pools


Robustness:

Context-based cancellation
Error handling throughout the pipeline
Graceful shutdown


Example Pipeline Flow:

Read CSV data from a file
Filter out negative values
Transform values (multiply by 1.5)
Aggregate by category in 5-second windows
Write results to an output file



To use this pipeline, you would need to:

Create an input CSV file with columns for ID, timestamp, value, category, and optional metadata
Run the program to process the data
Check the output file for results

This implementation provides a solid foundation that you can customize with additional sources, processors, and sinks to meet your specific data processing needs.
